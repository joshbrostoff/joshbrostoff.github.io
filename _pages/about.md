Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme. Perfect for hosting your personal site, blog, or portfolio on GitHub or self-hosting on your own server. As the name implies --- styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:.

{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery" caption="Examples of included layouts `splash`, `single`, and `archive`." %}

[Install the Theme]({{ "/docs/quick-start-guide/" | relative_url }}){: .btn .btn--success .btn--large}

## Notable Features

My name is Josh Brostoff, and I’m a Senior ServiceNow Developer living in Boston, MA. I used to work as developer at two ServiceNow customers before transitioning into the consulting space. I’m passionate about ITIL, service management, and all things ServiceNow.

I mainly focus on creating seamless experiences on ITSM and custom scoped applications to help organizations achieve their goals painlessly and, more importantly, as quickly as possible.

This blog is where I write about my experiences and innovations on the ServiceNow platform.
