My name is Josh Brostoff, and I’m a Senior ServiceNow Developer living in Boston, MA. I used to work as developer at two ServiceNow customers before transitioning into the consulting space. I’m passionate about ITIL, service management, and all things ServiceNow.

I mainly focus on creating seamless experiences for ITSM and custom scoped applications to help organizations achieve their goals painlessly and, more importantly, as quickly as possible.

This blog is where I write about my experiences and innovations on the ServiceNow platform.
