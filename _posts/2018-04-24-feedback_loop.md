title: " FeedBack Loop"

---


The ServiceNow HR application provides various key tools to running a seamless HR operation at an organization.  From knowledge management to employee inquiries, it *almost* provides a full circle solution for human resource management.  However, while using the tool, I came across a major product gap which is essential in HRIS – employee feedback.

Giving and receiving feedback is an essential piece to employee performance. 

After a project, engagement or extended period of employee interaction, it’s important to let others know how they are doing.  That’s what I have built FeedBack Loop, a custom scoped application within ServiceNow.

FeedBack loop is a way for employees to give and receive performance feedback, all built within ServiceNow.

Through a simple user interface, employees can provide performance reviews to co-workers in free text, or request feedback by proposing the three following questions:

1. What should I START doing?
2. What should I STOP doing?
3. What should I CONTINUE doing?

Here is how it works.

Employees navigate to the HR Service Portal within ServiceNow and create a new “Feedback” record.

From here, end users will be able to select if they want to give or receive feedback.  After submitting the record, the requested for user will receive an email notification, either letting them know their feedback is requested, or they have received feedback.  If feedback is requested, the other will be able simply enter a work note, all tracked within ServiceNow.  If feedback is given, the record will remain read only after submission.

Another advantage of the application is the ability to manage the native reporting functionality offered by ServiceNow.

Additionally, HR admins have the ability to control visibility to feedback records, control access, and more!
