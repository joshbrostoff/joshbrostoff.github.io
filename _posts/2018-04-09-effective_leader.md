title: "The Effective Leader"

---
Four years ago, I graduated college at the height of the second “tech bubble”. Since then, I have worked at various places, ranging from explosive growth tech companies, to a small consulting group. Along the way, I’ve tried to pick out the qualities of what I believe to be the effective leader.

**Walking around the office**

I can’t stress enough how important I believe it is that leaders frequently walk around the office and check in with employees at ALL levels. From my experience, more often than not, leaders at the director level and above get caught up in the wave of all day meetings and political garbage, and forget the human interaction piece. You can’t be a leader without knowing whats going on in the trenches. Even walking around for a quick check in can be a game changer for team moral.

**Motivator**

I’ve left jobs because of this, and I bet a lot of you reading this have to. If people don’t feel a purpose or sense of excitement behind what they’re doing, forget it. You can’t expect employees to produce quality work and change the world when they aren’t motivated.To be honest, most people would call my job where I look at code for eight hours a day painfully boring. But when you have a leader who is genuinely excited about the work you’re doing and can get you excited, it’s makes all the difference.

**Weekly updates**

I want to know what’s going on with the company and how we are moving forward as a whole. Are we closing new deals? Are we innovating? How are we going to perform better this quarter than we did last? 

**Recognition**

Call someone out when they do a good job.  People want to feel appreciated and let them know that their hard work doesn’t go unnoticed.  The time that people get the mentality of “no one knows how hard I work”, is the same time that effort levels and quality of work also suffer.

**Promotion/Market Salary**

Pay people what they deserve and what the market bears. No one wants to hear the corporate line “well we can just give you that, because that wouldn’t be fair to other employees.”  If people are performing above and beyond, being paid under market value, and the market is strong, it’s going to be to tough to keep talent around.
