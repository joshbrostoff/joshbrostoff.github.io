title: "Kick-Starting a Career in ServiceNow Development"

---

The ServiceNow space is hot, there is no doubt about that.  Many are desperately trying to get into the space as fast as they can, and that includes developers.

For those who are looking to kick start their career in ServiceNow development, or are new to the game, I wanted to share my experience as well as some guidance for lining yourself up for a successful ServiceNow journey.

**1. Start at a ServiceNow Customer / Work in IT**

My first exposure to ServiceNow was working production support tickets at a ServiceNow customer in the healthcare space.  Not only where was this where I learned about the backend of developing on ServiceNow, but *why* it actually provides value in an organization, how it relates to ITIL, and the pain points customers experience.  After doing production support and remediating defects, I transitioned into building basic catalog items.  This is a great way to learn about variables, workflows, and the service catalog.  Once you have gained a basic understanding of the system, ask for more complicated enhancements.

More importantly, I highly advise against trying to start your ServiceNow career in the consulting space.  Just because you are currently a programmer or studied computer science in college doesn’t mean you should dive head first into the space working for a consulting firm.  If you don’t understand the basics of ITSM or ITIL, this story will not end well.

**2. Take the ServiceNow System Administrator Course**

This is a great way to learn about the structure of the system and how to do basic configuration – adding fields, building workflows, tables and more. I took this course 6 months after I started developing on ServiceNow, and I still learned a ton of things I never knew.  This is a great way to build your foundation of knowledge about the platform.

**3. Take JavaScript on Code Academy**

Although ServiceNow is trying to achieve a “low code/no code” platform with every new release, there will ultimately always be a use case from a stakeholder that requires some type of coding.  Luckily, coding on ServiceNow is relatively pain free from a developer perspective.  There a million free (and cheap) ways to learn JavaScript.  When I was first getting started, I read [JavaScript and jQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development]( https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-JQuery-Interactive-Front-End-Development/dp/1118531647) by John Duckett.  This book is an excellent way to learn basic JavaScript, which covers variables, functions, objects, and even building a basic website.  

After this, I took the JavaScript course on [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com).  This course is completely free and gets you 90% of the way there for learning how to script in ServiceNow.

**4. Take the ServiceNow Scripting Course**
Although knowing JavaScript is essential for taking your skills on the platform to the next level, knowing the ServiceNow custom Java class, GlideRecord, is equally important.  GlideRecord provides an easy way to perform database operations on the platform without using SQL queries.  In the ServiceNow scripting course, you learn the basics of server and client-side scripting on the platform, GlideRecord, native methods, and more.

Learning how to script in ServiceNow is where the line between “administrator” and “developer” is drawn. Scripting on the platform is an absolute essential for taking your skills and value as a developer to the next level.  Once you learn this, the sky is the limit.

**5. ITIL/ ServiceNow Certifications**

Although you can say you have worked on the platform for “x” amount of time, employers want to see proof that you’re qualified to do the work.  As part of this, there are a few certifications that I would absolutely recommend getting.

Most IT shops run their organization on the ITIL framework, which is conveniently what ServiceNow is built on.  Having a basic understanding of ITIL is an absolute essential for your ServiceNow career. Taking the ITIL Foundations v3 course and certification is a great way to start out.

Once you have been working on the ServiceNow platform for ~6 months, getting the ServiceNow System Administrator certification the next step.  This is a great resume builder and lets potential employers know you have an intermediate understanding for the platform.

Once you have passed this certification, the next step is to become a certified application developer and implementation specialist.  This is really what starts to set you apart from the crowd and show that you are a more advanced developer on the platform.
