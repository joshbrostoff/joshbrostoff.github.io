title: "Fixing the Broken Survey"

---

Before I got into IT service management, I never really cared about surveys that companies sent me to review their products or services.  

Just the other day I received an electronic survey in my email from Comcast and immediately deleted it, as I suspect most others do.  It begs the question – why do only 1 out of 10 people fill out electronic surveys?  From a consumer perspective, filling out a 10-question survey doesn’t change anything for them.  Even if they had a bad experience, most don’t get their money back – and forget about someone actually reaching out to you to follow up.

From a company perspective, surveys provide invaluable data to help drive business decisions.  They can help build a better user experience, fix supply chain issues and identify to a pin where things went wrong.

Several years ago when I was taking an ITIL training, an instructor mentioned a process where customer service managers were automatically alerted when a survey was received below a certain rating.  From there, it would be a manager’s job to manually contact the customer and make things right.  Simple in concept, but a huge difference from a customer perspective.

To bring this to life, I wrote some basic code to do this exact behavior in ServiceNow.  Whether you use ServiceNow for Customer Service Management, or internal surveys, this can be a great value-add.

1.Create a new event which will fire upon low survey submission:

Example: low.score_submission

2.Create a new email notification with the following values:

- Send when: Event is fired
- Event name: low.score_submission
- Weight: 0
- Event parm 1 contains recipient: true

Body of email:
<a href="/assets/images/hr portal.png"><img src="/assets/images/Screen Shot 2018-08-24 at 8.27.09 PM.png"></a>

3.Create an email script to print the survey question responses:

```javascript
(function runMailScript(/* GlideRecord */ current, /* TemplatePrinter */ template,
/* Optional EmailOutbound */ email, /* Optional GlideRecord */ email_action,
/* Optional GlideRecord */ event) {

		var gr = new GlideRecord('asmt_assessment_instance_question');
		gr.addQuery('instance', current.sys_id);
		gr.query();
		while (gr.next()) {
			template.print(gr.metric.question.getDisplayValue() + ': ' + gr.value.getDisplayValue() + "\n");
		}
		
})(current, template, email, email_action, event);
```

4.Create a new business rule on update which will look for poor survey responses:

```javascript
var gr = new GlideRecord('asmt_assessment_instance_question');
	gr.addQuery('instance', current.sys_id);
	gr.addEncodedQuery('value=1^value=2');
	gr.query();
	if (gr.next()) {
		gs.eventQueue('low.score_submission',current,'poorsurveyresults@company.com',gs.getUserName());
	}
```
