title: "After Go-Live - Now What?"

---

So your organization has gone live with ServiceNow.  Now that’s out of the way, what’s next? 

Chances are your organization has just finished a 3-6 month implementation of ServiceNow focusing on ITSM or another major product line.  Although it seems like the hard part is over, maintaining and scaling the platform is an aspect that can’t be ignored.  

Having worked with dozens of ServiceNow customers, as well as in-house before that, I wanted to share some knowledge around setting up your team for success after Go-Live.

Staffing your team
One of the major drivers of organizational adoption and retaining your key players is staffing a ServiceNow team correctly.  Here are my recommendations for building a team after Go-Live:

Organizational Size: < 1,000 Employees
-	1 Product Owner/BPC
-	1 Architect
-	1 Developer
-	Remote Services contract with a ServiceNow partner	

Organizational Size: 1,000-3,000 Employees
-	1 Product Owner
-	1 Business Process Consultant
-	1 Architect
-	2 Developers
-	Remote Services contract with a ServiceNow partner

Organizational Size: 3,000-5,000 Employees
-	1 Product Owner
-	2 Business Process Consultants
-	1 Architect
-	3 Developers
-	Remote Services contract with a ServiceNow partner

Organizational Size: 5,000+ Employees
-	1 Product Owner
-	3 Business Process Consultants
-	1 Architect
-	5+ Developers
-	Remote Services contract with a ServiceNow partner



*Intake Process*
After Go-Live, you will likely start to receive a huge influx of enhancement requests as user adoption starts to grow, especially as people start to see the capabilities of the platform.  It is absolutely key that your team has a process in place to intake demands from the business.  Demand management in ServiceNow is a great tool to leverage.

Enhancement Request Vetting
Accepting any and every demand from the business is the #1 way to over customize your ServiceNow instance and build a product that no one wants to use.  One of the strategies I have used in the past is having a daily meeting with the product owner, business process consultant, and architect on the team to review every new demand from the business before deciding to move forward with it.

SDLC Process Tool
Being able to manage stories, defects, enhancements and releases is a must for staying organized.  I would highly recommend that your team adopt the Agile application in ServiceNow as your team will already be using the platform every day.  It’s a great tool and requires almost no configuration to start using.

Code Releases
With a huge influx of requests after Go-Live, it’s important to decide on a release cadence for enhancements and defects.  At the beginning, I would recommend weekly, and then transition to bi-weekly after achieving a steady state.

Training
Set up a quarterly tips and tricks training to educate new and existing employees on how to use the platform.  One of the main pieces of feedback I have received from end users over the years is the usability of the platform.  Teaching your end users how to use ServiceNow is a key to continuing to drive adoption.

Build a Roadmap
This is an item that every customer should have and maintain.  It not only gives your customers an idea of where the platform is going, but plays a key role in architectural decisions.

Schedule Governance Meetings
I can’t tell you how many times I have worked on teams where our customers can’t get what they need so they end up going with another tool.  Regularly meeting with your customers is key to understanding the needs of the business.

“Sell” ServiceNow
A lot of your customers will not know the depth of the platform.  When driving adoption at your organization, it’s important to meet with other business units to show them what’s possible.
