title: "Fixing the Broken Survey"

Since February of 2016, $NOW is up 268%. There have been some major changes over the course of the past few years that have taken the company to the next level, and have resulted in complete ITSM market dominance and a ~$35B market cap.

I wanted to outline some of those changes which I believe played a fundamental role in this recent takeoff.

**UI16/Service Portal**

One of the biggest complaints about ServiceNow prior to Helsinki was the clunky and outdated UI.  For all of you who remember the Aspen days, the addition of an end user facing portal built on AngularJS/Bootstrap was a game changer.

Service Portal literally “Makes Work, Work Better for People”. Employees can access what they need faster than ever before with less clicks and an Amazon-like ordering experience.  Service Portal is a major breakthrough in terms of usability and how employees perceive ServiceNow within their respective organizations.

**John Donahoe**

There comes a point in every company’s life when it needs a new leader to scale it to the next level.  With $NOW hovering at the $2B in annual revenue mark, that time came two years ago when ServiceNow brought in John Donahoe to take the reins.

Being the former CEO of Bain & Company and eBay, Donahoe was a perfect fit. Donahoe has a track record of scaling hyper growth companies. During his time at eBay, Donahoe doubled revenue for their marketplace, tripled revenue of PayPal, and made one of the best acquisitions in the past several decades with $STUB.

I recently got to see Donahoe speak at the Knowledge18 conference in Las Vegas and was extremely impressed with his knowledge of the product and his customer centric narrative.

**New Product Lines**

Gartner estimated that worldwide IT spending will hit $389 billion in 2018.  Two of the fastest growing sectors within IT are HR and Security Operations, both of which ServiceNow has built into debatably the best market solutions.  

With the platform already having a beautiful new service portal and extensive reporting application, it only made sense that their HR solution would be a perfect fit.  Additionally, we are now starting to see organizations implement HR on the platform before ITSM, leaving huge upsell potential.

ServiceNow has also developed an enterprise solution for the biggest IT crisis to date, information security.  Their new security operations product line leverages workflow automation to eliminate threats before they happen, as well as responding to security events.  With new OOB integrations being announced almost regularly, ServiceNow SecOps is just getting started.

**Marketing**

Until recently, if you asked most non-IT people if they had heard of ServiceNow, most would say no.  However, with the recent announcement of the Forbes Worlds #1 Most Innovative Company, this is likely soon to change.

With their expansion of new product lines and ability to dominate 42% of the ITSM market, ServiceNow has started to earn a name for itself.   

Along with this major recognition from Forbes, ServiceNow has started a major rebrand in which they are seeking to “Make work, work better for people”.  Although this might seem at first like a generic slogan to some, this represents a huge shift in the direction of ServiceNow.  In a time where most IT tools are clunky and difficult to use, ServiceNow is looking to change all of this.

**Developer Community**

You can’t build a world class enterprise platform solution without having an army of developers working to support the platform where it’s been implemented.  

While most major SASS companies are known for having poor documentation, and developer engagement training courses, ServiceNow has found a way to change this.  With the ServiceNow community, developers can post questions and have their questions answered within seconds.  

Developer celebrities such as Chuck Tomase, Travis Toulson, Brad Tilton, Mark Stranger and Pradeep Sharma along with many others have played a major role in supporting the developer community and taking the platform to the next level.


The past few years have been a major breakthrough for $NOW – and the rocket ship isn’t showing any signs of slowing down anytime soon.
